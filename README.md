C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. Despite its age, C remains a highly popular language, primarily due to its foundational role in computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

## Why Learn C?

- **Popularity**: C is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- **Foundation for Learning Other Languages**: Knowing C makes it easier to learn other popular languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc., due to similar syntax.
- **Speed**: C is very fast compared to other programming languages like Java and Python.
- **Versatility**: C is highly versatile and can be used in various applications and technologies.

## Difference Between C and C++

- **Extension**: C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages share almost the same syntax.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The main difference is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.
