## Introduction to C

### What is C?

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. Despite its age, C remains a highly popular language, primarily due to its foundational role in computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

### Why Learn C?

- **Popularity**: C is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- **Foundation for Learning Other Languages**: Knowing C makes it easier to learn other popular languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc., due to similar syntax.
- **Speed**: C is very fast compared to other programming languages like Java and Python.
- **Versatility**: C is highly versatile and can be used in various applications and technologies.

### Difference Between C and C++

- **Extension**: C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages share almost the same syntax.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The main difference is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.

## Installing Required Software

### Installing C Compiler and CodeLite IDE

To begin programming in C, you need to install a C compiler and an integrated development environment (IDE). For this guide, we will use the CodeLite IDE.

#### Windows

1. **Install the GCC Compiler**:
   - Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Follow the steps in this [installation guide](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
   - During installation, select the `gcc` component.

2. **Download and Install CodeLite IDE**:
   - Go to the [CodeLite download page](https://codelite.org/download).
   - Download the Windows installer and run it.
   - Follow the installation instructions.

#### Mac

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```sh
     xcode-select --install
     ```

2. **Download and Install CodeLite IDE**:
   - Go to the [CodeLite download page](https://codelite.org/download).
   - Download the macOS installer and run it.
   - Follow the installation instructions.

#### Linux

1. **Install GCC**:
   - Open a terminal and use your package manager to install GCC. For example, on Ubuntu, run:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```

2. **Download and Install CodeLite IDE**:
   - Go to the [CodeLite download page](https://codelite.org/download).
   - Download the appropriate package for your distribution and follow the installation instructions.

### Setting Up a Development Environment

Once CodeLite and the GCC compiler are installed, set up your development environment:

1. **Open CodeLite**.
2. **Create a new workspace**:
   - Go to `File` > `New` > `New Workspace`.
   - Enter a name and location for your workspace.
3. **Create a new project**:
   - Right-click on the workspace you created in the `Workspace` tab.
   - Select `New` > `New Project`.
   - Choose `Console Project` and click `Next`.
   - Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Writing Your First Program

### Hello, World! Example

Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started with C programming:

1. **Create a new file**:
   - In your CodeLite project, right-click on the `Source` folder.
   - Select `New` > `File`.
   - Name the file `main.c`.

2. **Write the following code in `main.c`**:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### Compiling and Running the Program

To compile and run your first C program:

1. **Build your project**:
   - Click the `Build` button in the toolbar or press `F7`.

2. **Run your program**:
   - Click the `Run` button in the toolbar or press `Ctrl+F5`.

You should see the output:

```output
Hello, World!
```


Congratulations! You've written and run your first C program.

## Common Errors in C

### Compiler Errors

Compiler errors occur when the source code violates the syntax rules of the C language. These errors prevent the program from being compiled successfully.

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n)
    return 0;
}
```

#### Error Message
```vbnet
main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:4:5: error: missing terminating " character
    4 |     printf("Hello, World!\n)
      |     ^~~~~~
```
**Explanation**

In this example, the closing double-quote " is missing at the end of the printf statement.

### Compiler Warnings

Compiler warnings indicate potential issues in the code that may not prevent the program from compiling but could lead to unexpected behavior.

Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;
    printf("Value of x is: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Warning Message
```bash

main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:5:30: warning: 'x' is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
    5 |     printf("Value of x is: %d\n", x);
      |                         ^
```

**Explanation**

In this example, the variable x is used without being initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior.

### Linker Errors

Linker errors occur when the compiled code references symbols (functions, variables, etc.) that are not defined.

#### Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    extern void undefinedFunction();
    undefinedFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

#### Error Message
```vbnet

undefined reference to `undefinedFunction'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```
**Explanation**

In this example, the undefinedFunction is declared but not defined, causing a linker error.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur when the program compiles successfully but encounters issues while running, such as accessing invalid memory or dividing by zero.

#### Example
```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 0;
    int c = a / b;
    printf("Result is: %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Error Message
```bash
Floating point exception (core dumped)
```

**Explanation**

In this example, dividing by zero causes a runtime error.



## What will be the output of the following code?

```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()

    {

        int x = 1, y = 0, z = 5;

        int a = x && y && z++;

        printf("%d", z);

    }
```
Ans: ```5```

```Explanation: ``` 

In the above, x && y evaluates to false and since there is && z++ never gets executed. This is referred as short-circuit evaluation where the second boolean evaluation never gets evaluated because it does not need to because the first is false (in an && expression)
